## Vuejs task Project
This is a Single Page Application build with Vue2 and Vuex

I have used Vue Router for menu and Store to manage state.

Have used axios for Ajax API calls and token for authentication.
A token refresh is needed for a more secure authentication!

For layouts I have used bootstrap and same custom css

Maybe my most of the time was spend in Vuejs app as I have been using Vuejs only recently
and probably I lack some kind of structure design but I am really looking forward to work with Vue


## Build Setup

``` bash
# Clone project

$ git clone https://github.com/bekimfetahu/continuum-vue.git

$ cd continuum-vue

# install dependencies

$ npm install

# Modify SERVER_API ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/api ) if backend is served in with other IP and Port

config/dev.env.js
config.prod.env.js

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

$ npm run dev

Load into browser

http://localhost:8080

```
```
Login:
user:admin@admin.com
pass:password
```

Thank you for your time :)
